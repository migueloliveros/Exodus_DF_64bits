# Exodus_DF_64bits
If you had to flee your home country or state due to criminal gang extortion, a civil or socio-political conflict, an economic crisis or for instance the expropriation of your private land by a corrupted public agency; the one piece of technology you would take with you in this exodus is without a doubt, your smart/mobile phone. 
Since 2015, the year the first mass migration, geopolitical and transnational crisis of the digital age started I have carried out field studies across European borders, hotspots and Central American refugee camps where emerging mobile technologies are playing a vital role not only in the lives of the refugees/migrants, the people working at the borders, the human traffickers and the smugglers, but also in the lives of those who, like me, care to audiovisually document such humanitarian exoduses and raise consciousness. 
In the case of this article I will present a first-person experience and point of view account, of a unique humanitarian exodus -the first of the digital age in Central America- which took place between the 9th and the 14th of November 2018 at the temporary refugee camp installed in the “Jesús Martinez Palillo” Stadium, Mexico D.F. And which saw thousands of Salvadorians, Honduran, Nicaraguan and Guatemalan refugees crossing Mexico towards the militarized southern borders of the United States. 
This historical event which I witness in addition with all the “sensitive” multimedia material collected during the crisis, lead to the creation of a reactive, 3D videomixer, synthesizer and glitch system conceptually rooted in the plasticity of the audiovisual image, the ambisonic systems and the Rutt-Ettra video synthesizer. A complex broadcast 64 bits system which aims at reframing consciousness by immersing the audience in a hypnotic multisensorial interactive experience where the manipulation of the audio and the visual content results in forms of empathy in an age of insensitive audiences.
